haklog is a functional dialect of prolog without the cut.

a quick overview of the differences: 

classic prolog example:

    member(X,[X|_]).
    member(X,[_|T]) :- member(X,T).

the same in haklog:

    member x x,_:;
    member x _,t :- member x t

prolog   vs     haklog
[H|T]           h,t
[1,2,3]         [1 2 3]
atom            'atom
Variable        variable/Variable
_               _
X is 1+2        x = {1+2}
X = 1 + 2       x = 1+2
foo(X,Y)        foo x y
predicates      functions
!               n/a
foo.            foo :;
foo :- bar      foo :- bar
foo, bar        foo && bar
foo, !, bar     foo and bar   {foo; bar}
foo ; bar       foo || bar   
(foo,!); bar    foo or bar
foo -> bar      foo -> bar
                if (foo -> bar)* expr
fail            fail
member(X,Y)     X in Y
write           say

findall(X,foo(X),L)
                L = every foo x
call(X)         eval x

a rough overview of the syntax - check parser.pl for specifics 

haklog syntax is inspired by tk in that when you call a function
the arguments are not evaluated but treated like a string. haklog
does not evaulate the arguments, but like prolog it binds variables.

haklog is like prolog in that arguments are not evaluated, but variables
are bound before calling:

foo x y z    call the function foo with x y and z
foo 1+2      call the function foo with the structure '1+2'

i.e. unification.

here is an example block:

foo x y :- {
    z = {bar x}
    x * 2
}

{}'s can have spaces,newlines or ; seperating statements. same for []'s  ()'s can
only contain one statement

here is a list: [1 2 3 4] if I call 
foo [1+2 3+4], it recieves  a list containing 1+2 3+4
but x = [1+2 3+4], x = [3 7]

foo followed by items is a function call
foo on it's own is a variable.

here is another example: append

append [] x :- x
append h,t x :- h,{append t x}

(warning, although things like
[1 2 3 4] = {append x [3 4]}
works, it doesn't work efficiently)

if you load eval into swi prolog, you can get a semi repl:

?- exec("1 or 2 or 3",Env,Res).
Env = [],
Res = 1 ;
Env = [],
Res = 2 ;
Env = [],
Res = 3 ;
false.


todo: less bugs, more documentation, less code.

possible language features:
    aggregate operators  3 + list is  {every (X in list && 3 + X)}
    closures ? anonymous function defs (maybe (_ x y) :- foo)
    string operations ? more sugar ? case statements? 
    message passing? erlang-like concurrency ? modules ? libraries?
    i/o ? difference lists? pegs? dcgs?
    mutable assignment?
    xml literals? url literals?
