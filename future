a plan for native haklog compilation
====================================

A vision for a finished compiler, not to be confused with a plan to get there.

prolog has traditionally seen poor adoption because of piss poor speed, haklog 
is much less deterministic, but still heavily dynamic. any interpretation will
come at a heavy runtime penalty.

we want to pass this burden to compile time as much as possible. the end goal
is native code.

haklog compiler outline
-----------------------

parse haklog into abstract syntax tree -
    no re-writing, minimal optimization, constant folding

translate ast into core haklog -
    a well defined tree ir with explicit: outputs, unification, closures etc.
    the core language has simple operators with well defined semantics

the following passes will likely have to be iterative, building from
the bottom up, co-operatively.

    inference phases - 
        mode inference, type inference
        region inference/escape analysis - essentially explicit 
        allocation deallocation
        these will be based on the notion of success types - we try to
        exclude some wrongly typed code, but we cannot exclude all.
        
        i.e we try to be as specific as we can, if we can - 
            reducing types from any() to specific types like int()
            turning heap allocations into specific allocations (stack/region)
        but fall back to simple types when unknown

    possible optimization passes on the core subset -
        rewriting comparisons to be optimal, avoid non-determinism.
        partial evaluation of the core subset through term re-writing
        based on compile time type information, e.g:
            decomposing unification

now at this point we should have two things for each function,
    a signature -
        a record of all the information which will need to be provided
        at runtime to execute i.e types, modes and regions.
        and the constraints they need to satisfy
    and a function -
        hopefully optimized as much as possible with static information

top down phase - compilation to machine code
    if we know the signature values, we can compile the function into machine code

    we can then do global analysis, from the main program infer the component types,
    and generate a function for each required signature. 

    essentially we treat every function as a generic function with respect to the types
    (and modes, etc) of its arguments and output, with the exception of main()

    we can have a compiler that given a core haklog function and signature values,
    compiles machine code for that function.




compilation in depth 
--------------------
one approach is to split the compilation process into two:
    
    we have a transformer that given a core haklog program and signature values
    returns an exactly typed haklog program
    (we can generate this program through partial evaluation (futamura projection))
    
    and a second that takes an exactly typed haklog program and compiles
    it to machine code.

however, this approach can be slow in practice, although it is frequently
the standard approach for run time code generation. alternatively, the fabius ml 
compiler achieves rtcg in  novel way, to produce machine code that generates machine
code at runtime.

we can seperate code into runtime and staged segments, and then proceed to compile
each step to machine code. 

we we introduce an emit instruction, we can transform the function initially into
a series of emit statements, and then re-write them into haklog code that produces
them dependant on signature values.

we can then procede to compile not only the haklog functions, but the emit instructions 
too to assembly, peforming things like register colouring on both the core and the staged code.

this is not new territory,  metaocaml is an example of a staged compiler.

essentially we transform haklog into a statically typed language that produces statically
typed code at runtime.

fun aside: by using the type system to declare runtime/compile time information
we effectively have a multi stage language, albeit most type systems are simple.

if we then want to introduce matrix operation optimizations, we need to move information
out of values and into types, i.e. dependant types.  we can then introduce abstract 
dependant data types, to get compile time optimizations.

i.e the type system is a constraint system on the code generation

idiomatic compilation
=====================
we want to remove all of the functional idioms from the code as we translate it to
machine code.

this means removing recursion (tail), and transformation into iteration.
we also need to do liveness analysis, to identify re-usable values.
we should be able to convert pure functions into destructive ones
for at least a given set of operations - i.e accumulators.

we should be able to infer linear types and unique types too to aid this
i.e unique types guarantee no references to it, but a linear type means
no other references are made.

ie we can transform existing mutable operations into unique types and 
de-compose them to working on a dcg like basis

however, if we can infer linear types, we should be able to 




core haklog
===========
notion: everything is explicit - no unification in arguments
inspired by binprolog, core erlang, and "inventing a prolog"

outputs are explicit, operations chained together with binary operators

def(X,Y,Z) is(X,Y,Z) 
or(X,Y) conj(X,Y) if(X,Y) not(X) xor(X,Y)
add(X,Y,Z)
let(X,Y)

defined in prolog syntax, possible operator overloading for sanity reasons.

we define all operations on core haklog as re-writing


rough roadmap
=============
define core haklog in prolog
translate haklog into core
translate core into prolog
term ordering optimizations
bottom up inference
top down propagation -
compile typed haklog into ml , c?
compile core haklog into metaml ?, tickc ?
