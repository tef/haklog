    make unify return value, avoid pattern in value
    partial pretty printer 
    strings are lists patterns in strings
    regex character classes and ranges
    ++ is append pattern composition
    == is equality does not instanciate variables
    x^l is x* , l = length(x)

    make 3+4 work




crazy next:
    cyclic lists? omega operator? co-inductive logic for haklog

prolog tweaks:
    use assoc lists for environment
    pure io for parsing - will speed it ups

forward:
    prolog translation
    use linear state threads to flatten code

operators
    c
    range matches 0,1 1: 3..4
    := ? alias for is ? alias for set ?
    need to doo foo[x] 
     foo[a[b]] is z=  foo[a] and z[b]; z maybe x / 'foo / 'y hmmm -> 'foo->l in x ;'y->v in l; v  
    string interpolation, """ """ strings
    change == to evaluating operator

data types:
    sets? union intersect?
    mutable variables -- x! - essentially unique references
    everything isn't an object - everything one of a few basic types:
        scalar, collection, function, expression (byrd points) 
     
patterns/variable quantifiers
    ' quoting to escape patterns - quoting to escape values? ::- define a function that returns a function
    '{} escape block
    closure operator i.e prevent binding foo `x
features:
    imports, modules, namespaces
    prolog operator predicate
    operator overloading? X + Y :- X - Y could work?
control flow?
    instead of i/o ? build repl on top of it, use threading hack
    suspended execution? thing is @foo x y lazy evaluation essentialy. x is thing 
    
housekeeping:
    pretty printer
    repl - seperate thread using mutex for locks or breaks
    prelude ?
 

syntax:
    xml literals? url literals?
    xpath ?

message passing/processes:
    send X blah blah blah
    recv x 1 -> 2 3 ->4
    spawn

what about asynchronous message handling? register handlers instead of 
writing a dispatch loop over and over again?

define a process


strings:
    string replacement ?
    uses prolog native strings.
    need to turn concat into a stream operator
    alternatively: treat append like cons, strings like lists

    "foo ${} $a"
    """ fooo foo
    foo foo"

    regexes?
    /foo bar /



compile to primitive forms with bird boxes, without nested blocks.

need meta types:

scalar, iterable, callable
