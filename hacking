next steps:
    test harness
    documentation 

    together - some way of saying "this does this" and making sure the examples execute?
    docstrings ?
    doctests ?

    $test "addition" : {
        """ toot toot parp parp """
        1+2 == 3
    } 

    $log "foooo"

new semantics:

    record/hash types as native type ?  "foo" : bar  
        lua sematics list part and an assoc part (with ordering)
        index operator

    mutable variable  + := operator
    
    let operator as inverted where.

    global variables $foo 
        $test - run a test
        $log -  log somethin (stderr by default)
        $stdin, $stdout, $stderr
        $args

        where clause awesomeness.

        spawn/exec? some method of inheriting

    need way of:
       caputring blocks in an unf -- special form '{ ?
       caputring the var closure of an expression
       
    remove message passing and introduce stdin, stdout, stderr as standard 
    pipes (really queues) and |>  as into a file and  |< as from a file and | as pipe

    named shared state with put/get/delete semantics - using url as names

    need shell like primitives - say, warn, cat, write, read, print
            need some way of saying x = get foo and dump get foo or `get foo` hmm.
                maybe print {get foo} :3
    
        
    imports? sharing

    exceptions for non-local exits

done:
    case statements?  if statements xor closures anonymous functions 
    foo() syntax y combinator maybe, $ call syntax
    make unify return value, avoid pattern in value
    partial pretty printer 
    strings are lists patterns in strings
    regex character classes and ranges
    ++ is append pattern composition
    == is equality does not instanciate variables
    x^l is x* , l = length(x)
    x^? is the non greedy version x is y 
    moved patterns into own operator =~ out of =
    moved reserved words into parser.
    standard library for lists/functions
    aggregate operators  3 + list is  {every (X in list && 3 + X)}
    simple file i/o  
    message passingr,? erlang-like concurrency 
    numerical ranges with ..  2 ** 3
    make 3+4 work



crazy next:
    cyclic lists? omega operator? co-inductive logic for haklog

prolog tweaks:
    use assoc lists for environment
    pure io for parsing - will speed it ups

forward:
    prolog translation
    use linear state threads to flatten code

operators
    range matches 0,1 1: 3..4
    := ? alias for is ? alias for set ?
    need to doo foo[x] 
     foo[a[b]] is z=  foo[a] and z[b]; z maybe x / 'foo / 'y hmmm -> 'foo->l in x ;'y->v in l; v  
    string interpolation, """ """ strings
    change == to evaluating operator

data types:
    sets? union intersect?
    mutable variables -- x! - essentially unique references
     
patterns/variable quantifiers
    ' quoting to escape patterns - quoting to escape values? ::- define a function that returns a function
    '{} escape block
    closure operator i.e prevent binding foo `x

    ' means treat as unify_var in eval context - or stop eval on block.
    ` means treat as eval in unf context - i.e { }


features:
    imports, modules, namespaces
    prolog operator predicate
    operator overloading? X + Y :- X - Y could work?
control flow?
    instead of i/o ? build repl on top of it, use threading hack
    suspended execution? thing is @foo x y lazy evaluation essentialy. x is thing 
    
housekeeping:
    pretty printer
    repl - seperate thread using mutex for locks or breaks
    prelude ?
 

syntax:
    xml literals? url literals?
    xpath ?

message passing/processes:
    send X blah blah blah
    recv x 1 -> 2 3 ->4
    spawn

what about asynchronous message handling? register handlers instead of 
writing a dispatch loop over and over again?

define a process


strings:
    string replacement ?
    uses prolog native strings.
    need to turn concat into a stream operator
    alternatively: treat append like cons, strings like lists

    "foo ${} $a"
    """ fooo foo
    foo foo"

    regexes?
    /foo bar /



compile to primitive forms with bird boxes, without nested blocks.

need meta types:

scalar, iterable, callable
